I conducted a thorough audit and found that recent changes to the website caused tracking issues, leading to inaccurate conversion data. I quickly fixed the tracking setup in Google Tag Manager and updated the conversion actions in Google Ads. Additionally, I reviewed and adjusted bids and budgets to stabilize performance. These actions helped restore the campaign’s performance within a week.",

    "question": "How do you measure the success of a Google Ads campaign?",
    "answer": "I measure the success of a Google Ads campaign by tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) aligned with the campaign goals. These KPIs typically include CTR, conversion rate, cost per conversion, ROI, and overall return on ad spend (ROAS). I also monitor metrics like quality score, ad relevance, and impression share to ensure the campaign is optimized for performance. Regular reporting and analysis help in making data-driven decisions to achieve the desired outcomes.",

    "question": "What strategies do you use for remarketing?",
    "answer": "For remarketing, I create segmented audiences based on user behavior, such as website visitors, cart abandoners, and past customers. I tailor ad creatives and messages to each segment, emphasizing different value propositions and offers. Dynamic remarketing is particularly effective for showing personalized ads with products users have viewed. I also set frequency caps to avoid overexposure and use different ad formats and platforms, like Google Display Network and YouTube, to reach users effectively.",
